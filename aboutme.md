My name is Nik Coventry. I am the Lead Nurse for this project:

- We are developing a new adult inpatient digital health record using oracle APEX
- The first release will contain key nursing risk assessments and care plans
- We have foccused on user centred design and workflow, not simply creating digital versions of paper documents

What else do you need to know?

### Mobile Devices

The really exiciting part is that the development can be accessed on mobile devices
